##### Objectives

> After my BeCode training, I'd like to work as a machine learning ingeneer. I think it's the AI branch that will suit me best. In fact, I prefer not to be involved in a commercial way. I like the  scientific way, beeing able to help technological advances. Data Engineer could fit me too. If the subject interest me, it could be great  to manipulate millions of data about it.
